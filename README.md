# Restaurant-Sales-report-EDA-and-Analysis
This repository presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of restaurant sales data. The analysis includes data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and measures of dispersion such as standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. The main goal is to uncover sales patterns and customer behavior, providing valuable insights for business decision-making. This project also serves as a learning resource for data analysis techniques.
- Data Understanding and Preparation
  * Data Exploration: Each column in the dataset was examined to understand its data type, values, and any inconsistencies.
  * Data Cleaning: Addressed issues such as missing values, duplicates, and outliers to ensure the integrity of the data.
- Analysis Techniques
  * Descriptive Statistics: Calculated measures such as mean, median, and mode to summarize the central tendency of the data.
  * Measures of Dispersion: Assessed the spread of the data using standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis.
  * Correlation Analysis: Explored relationships between different variables to identify potential correlations and dependencies.
- Findings and Insights
  * Sales Patterns: Identified trends and patterns in sales data over time.
  * Customer Behavior: Analyzed customer purchase behavior to determine peak hours, popular menu items, and frequent customer demographics.
  * Statistical Measures: Provided insights into data distribution and variability.
- Tools and Technologies Used
  * Excel: Utilized for initial data manipulation, cleaning, and basic analysis.
  * Python: Employed for advanced data analysis and visualization, using libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib.
- Future Work
  * Advanced Analytics: Implement machine learning models to predict sales and customer trends.
  * Data Visualization: Develop interactive dashboards using tools like Tableau or Power BI for real-time insights.
  * Expanded Data Sources: Integrate additional data sources, such as customer feedback and external market data, to enrich the analysis.
